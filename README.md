# Data Set: 2023 Yellow Taxi Trips
We chose a comprehensive dataset depicting upwards of 37 million real taxi rides in New York city for 2023, which we obtained from the government domain of public datasets on the US Data Government website. To accomodate for the limits of Tableau, we narrowed the data down to the top 20 drop-off and pick-up locations before conducting any analyses, giving us around 13 million rides to assess. Attributes of the dataset include the trip distance, drop-off and pick-up datetimes, drop-off and pick-up location codes, rate types, payment types, passengers per ride, total amount, airport fees, and many more variables which we did not use to out of irrelevance to our project's focus. 
# Team Questions
## Overarching Question
Are there certain scenarios and instances that make taxi's more profitable for the driver? What about scenarios where the customer benefits over other ride systems like Uber and Lyft?

In a fast moving and technological society, it is very common to see goods and services that were once bustling with popularity get replaced by more efficient, automated tools. With a handful of various ride-share systems competing against eachother, we thought the data in this dataset could be useful to indicate customer behaviors specific to New York City and how the iconic yellow taxi system handles comeptition in the evolving transportation market.

## Supplemental Question 1
How does the cost per mile change given the pick up location and the trip distance? What might this indicate about taxi users?

Looking at the dataset's top 20 popular pickup locations in NYC, we wanted to see how far customers typically drive given the location they are picked up at, as well as the average cost per mile they are paying on those trips. By comparing these two data, we hoped that answering this question could help us find out if there are areas where riders can get a great deal for their trip and take advantage of cheaper fares that otherwise would not get them as far in an Uber or Lyft.

## Supplemental Question 2
How do taxi prices change between airport rides and regular city rides?

This question helps to understand the profitability of the taxi driver and whether or not their charge of airport fees upticks their ride fares out of the range of the average ride-share system, decreasing their competitive advantage. 

# Applied Manipulations
## Manipulation 1
For the first supplemental question, we created a new calculated field titled 'Cost per Mile' which we used to find the average amount paid by a customer per mile for the taxi drivers to deliver them to their destination.

## Manipulation 2
Our second calulated field was titled 'Airport Trip' which we used to manipulate the data under 'Airport Fee' to differentiate between rides that did have an airport fee (were rides to the airport) and those that didn't (rides that were not to the airport) for our second supplemental question.

# Analysis and Results
## Supplemental Question 1
To find the answer to our first supplemental quesiton, we started with a line graph indicating the relationship between the average ride distance from each pickup location, labeled with the average distance in miles. Underneath this we paired the line graph with a bar graph indicating the relationship between the average cost per mile driven at each pick up location. Immediately upon pairing these two graphs together, we noticed two interesting relationships occuring at locations 132 and 138. There was a spike that indicated further rides took place while the average cost per mile was the lowest at these locations.

Before coming to any conclusions, we made a second graph to better visually understand this relationship. This graph shows the area covered for the same relationships of average distance per trip and cost per mile with each pickup location. This time however, we labeled the graph with the average total cost for a ride by a customer. The union of these graphs made it more obvious that customers were spending more money at the locations where they were going farther distances, but recieving lower fare costs. This suggests that because fares were so cheap at these locations, customers were more willing to be taken further or closer to their actual destination instead of walking from further away to avoid high fares. While we only looked at the twenty most popular locations for taxi pickups, this ties us back to our overarching question stating that the average taxi customer will change their behavior depending on the deals they can get from the driver.

## Supplemental Question 2
While we were given the fees for the rides to the airports, we wanted to find a direct comparison in total costs for rides to the airport versus rides to anywhere else in the city. We also wanted to compare the price breakdown, along with the average trip distance to see what portions of the price change were attributed by the airport fees versus the fact that the riders were being taken farther. We ultimately decided a three-way bar chart comparing these features was the best way to differentiate between each attribute for non-airport rides and airport rides. We observed that while the general fares were higher for airport rides, only a very small portion of that was actually attributed by the airport fee. With this being said, we also observed that the distance travelled for airport rides was signifigcantly more than city rides. We can assume from these observations that while the airport rides were more expensive than regular rides, they were at a competitive price point with Ubers and Lyfts because regardless for the airport fee as the bulk of each ride cost comes from the distance of the ride to the airport. We can therefore further assume that any other business would also have to upcharge longer drives, meaning that a customer would not be at a real loss choosing a taxi over another ride-share systems when trying to go to the airport.

## Conclusion
Together, these two experimental data analyses we completed for this project help us see the behavioral descision-making tactics of taxi users and taxi drivers in New York when compared against Ubers, Lyfts, and other competitors. Our first supplemental question helped us to see real proof of areas where riders took advantage of the deals they were getting at certain locations comapred to other modes of transportation. Additionally, Our second data analysis shows us that when it comes to airport demand, taxis keep a competitive price and do not generally hike up their airport fees as to not deter any customers that will otherwise exchange taxis for Uber or Lyft. In all, these two examples answer out overarching question, showing that that customers will find deals where they can within the NYC taxi system, while the taxi rivers maintain a comeptitive market price for sustaianble competitive edge.
